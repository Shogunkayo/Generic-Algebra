## Introduction

This project is a simplified clone of numpy in C++ for vector and matrix operations. The main focus was to study and implement generic programming concepts like:
- Variadic templates
- Template specialization
- Lambda templates
- Fold expressions
- Type traits
- Template friendship
- Concepts and Constraints

We have not used any implementation from STL. Instead we have implemented our own Vector data structure with few variants. Please refer to the files in src/ for samples which demonstrate how to use this library.
